JOUIN

Not a food delivery platform.
A correction to the food delivery model.

Traditional delivery platforms frustrate everyone involved:

Merchants lose margin to high commissions

Consumers pay more, get less, and wait longer

Platforms carry heavy logistics and labor costs

Join deliberately avoids this model.

Why Consumers Are Tired of Food Delivery Platforms
1️⃣ Less food, higher prices

To survive 25%–35% platform commissions, restaurants:

Reduce portion sizes

Increase menu prices

Consumers pay more for less value

2️⃣ Fees stacked on top of fees

A single order often includes:

Delivery fee

Platform service fee

Peak-time surcharge

Small order fee

The price inflates before the food even arrives.

3️⃣ Unreliable delivery times

Promised 30 minutes, delivered in 60

Food prepared early but delayed by driver batching

Meals arrive cold and disappointing

4️⃣ Forced “instant delivery”

Most people don’t actually need food immediately.
They want:

Predictable timing

Reasonable pricing

Normal portions

Delivery platforms force everyone into the same “instant” model, whether it makes sense or not.

Why Merchants Are Also Stuck

High commissions crush margins

Opting out means losing visibility

Platforms control pricing and customer access

How Join Is Fundamentally Different
1️⃣ No logistics, no drivers

Join does not manage delivery

Merchants choose:

Self-delivery

Pickup only

Logistics costs are not pushed onto consumers

Result: a lighter, cheaper platform structure.

2️⃣ Subscription-based, not commission-based

Traditional platforms: take a cut from every order

Join: monthly / feature-based subscriptions

More orders mean:

Merchants earn more

Consumers pay less

Platform incentives align with both sides

3️⃣ Group-buying instead of single-order delivery

Demand is aggregated before fulfillment

One preparation, multiple orders

Higher order density, lower operational waste

Ideal for:

Offices

Residential communities

Repeat customers

4️⃣ Demand confirmed before cooking

Clear deadlines

Minimum target required to activate a campaign

Preparation and pickup times are defined upfront

No guessing.
No waiting on driver availability.

5️⃣ The platform as a “transaction amplifier”

Join focuses only on:

Group formation logic

Order and status tracking

Subscription and payment management

Join does not:

Set prices

Control menus

Own customer relationships

One-Sentence Summary

Delivery platforms sell “instant.”
Join restores “reasonable.”

Turning fragmented, expensive, unpredictable orders
into predictable, affordable, sustainable transactions.
